# AI for Developers – January 2026  
# Individual Project Assignment

---

## Overview

You will create a **Google Drive Document** describing a small software project that you built using GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, Augment Code, Cursor, or a combination of these tools.

---

## Choose Your Own Project Topic

- Select any small software system (script, automation, API, mini-app, CLI tool, etc.).
- Describe the idea and the system requirements in **up to 1 page**.

---

## System Architecture – Modules

- Use AI to break the system down into several **technological modules** (e.g., authentication, data processing, UI, database layer, automation step, testing layer, etc.).
- For each module, describe your approach and how AI assisted you.

---

## Development Process per Module

For every module, include:

1. **Approach & reasoning** – how you planned the solution  
2. **Step-by-step workflow** – what you asked the tool to generate or modify  
3. **Testing strategy** – how you validated correctness  
4. **AI tool choice** – which tool you used (Copilot, Claude Code, Augment, Cursor, etc.) and why  
5. **Key prompts or interactions** (2–3 examples are enough)

Keep the description for each module **up to half a page**.

---

## Challenges & Tool Comparison

A section where you explain:

- The **biggest challenges** you encountered  
- Which tool helped you the most and **why**  
- What you would improve if you continued working on the project  

---

## Working System Evidence

- Include at least **two screenshots** of the functioning system.
- This can be the terminal, UI, logs, Postman result, or anything that proves the implementation works.

---

## Repository

- Provide a link to your **GitHub repository** containing the source code.

---

## Submission Format

- **Link to Google Drive Document** (make sure it is shared – anyone with the link can view).
- **Total size:** typically **3–6 pages**.
